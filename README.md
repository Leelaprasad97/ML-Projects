# Portfolio Projects


In this portfolio, I am thrilled to present my Machine Learning projects, each representing a journey I have cherished every step of. Along this path, I have achieved excellence in problem feature engineering, feature selection, model building, and the art of deploying solutions seamlessly using Streamlit.


## 1. Traffic Estimation Using Satellite Images
This project employs high-resolution satellite imagery and advanced object detection models to estimate road traffic. By utilizing Detectron-2 and Faster R-CNN, vehicles are accurately counted, correlating with Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) data for specific zip codes. The research demonstrates the potential of merging geospatial data with machine learning for transportation planning. The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 80% in vehicle detection. While promising, further improvements, including dynamic variables integration, can enhance model accuracy. This work showcases a novel approach, providing a foundation for future advancements in traffic estimation using satellite imagery and machine learning.

## 2. Text Summarization
In my project, I conducted a comprehensive evaluation of abstractive text summarization using Google's Flan-T5 and PEGASUS models. The study included a comparative analysis on Kaggle News articles Dataset and Hindi news articles, showcasing the Flan-T5 model's superior performance. This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in NLP and model evaluation, but also highlights my ability to conduct in-depth research and draw meaningful conclusions from the data. It's a testament to my skills in leveraging cutting-edge technologies for practical applications.

## 3. Skin Cancer Detection
In my project, I leveraged advanced artificial neural networks to tackle the critical issue of skin lesion classification for early skin cancer detection. Using deep learning techniques, I developed a custom 17-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch and achieved an impressive 95% accuracy. Additionally, I applied transfer learning with pretrained models like VGG19, EfficientNetB7, and ResNet152V2, fine-tuning them for skin lesion classification. This approach significantly improved accuracy to 97%. My work highlights the potential of AI in improving skin cancer diagnosis, and I aim to extend this research with larger datasets and explore more sophisticated transfer learning methods.

## 4. Real-Time Object Detection
This project delves into DAMO-YOLO, a cutting-edge object detection model surpassing previous YOLO iterations. Through Neural Architecture Search, Feature Pyramid Networks, and model distillation, DAMO-YOLO achieves impressive accuracy and speed trade-offs. The report provides a comprehensive implementation guide for real-time object detection using YOLOv5. Results demonstrate its capability to accurately categorize objects. The study emphasizes the pivotal role of high-quality training data in enhancing model performance. YOLOv5's adaptability to custom datasets, coupled with efficient GPU processing, positions it as a powerful tool across various industries, promising to redefine real-time object detection applications.



## 5. Quora Duplicate Question Pair Detector
Quora is a question-answering website where users can ask and answer questions on a variety of topics. However, Quora also has to deal with duplicate questions, which can be a problem for both users and the platform as a whole. Duplicate questions can make it difficult for users to find the answers they are looking for, and they can also lead to users wasting time answering questions that have already been answered.
The objective of Quora duplicate question pair detection project is to identify pairs of questions that are essentially asking the same thing. This can be done by using natural language processing techniques to extract features from the questions that can be used to measure their similarity. Once a pair of questions has been identified as duplicate, they can be merged together so that users only see one version of the question.

## 6. Customer Segmentation Analysis Project:
The objective of a customer clustering project is to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics. This can be used to improve customer segmentation, target marketing campaigns, and develop new products and services.
I will be performing an unsupervised clustering of data on the customer's records from a groceries firm's database.

## 7. Collaborative recommendation engine - Books recommendation:
It attempts to find users that have similar preferences and opinions as the input and then recommends items that they have liked to the input.

## 8. Forecasting - Walmart sales
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast sales for the next year.This will be achieved by using a Time series techniques to train the model on historical sales data, as well as other relevant factors such as Temperature on the given date and CPI at that time. The model will be evaluated on its ability to predict future sales with high accuracy, and the results will be used to inform business decisions about inventory management, Resource allocation, Marketing strategies...etc.

## 9. SMS SPAM Classifier
Spam is a major problem for users. It can be time-consuming and annoying to filter out spam messages, and it can also be a security risk.
The objective of this project is to develop a spam classifier that can be used to automatically classify messages as spam or ham (not spam). This can help users to quickly and easily identify and filter out spam messages.

## 10. Content based recommendation engine
The objective of a content-based recommendation system is to recommend items to a user that are similar to items that the user has previously interacted with. This is done by extracting features from the items that the user has interacted with and then using these features to find other items that are similar. 

## 11. Laptop price predictor
The objective is to develop a laptop price predictor model that can accurately predict the price of a laptop based on its features. The model will be evaluated using a variety of metrics, such as R2 score and MAE. The model will be deployed as a web application so that consumers can use it to make informed decisions about which laptop to buy.
